title: Dwarf Planets
meta: Dwarf Planets are smaller in mass to their bigger "brothers" but still hold some qualifications to list them as planets rather than as just celestial objects, such as asteroids and meteors

There are currently 4 planets in this category, all of which are currently located in the Kuiper Belt. These planets are Pluto, Eris, Haumea, and Makemake. These rules determine the classification of a dwarf planet:

- Is in orbit around the Sun,
- Has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape,
- Has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit, and
- Is not a satellite, aka not caught in an orbit around a planet.

Pluto — at one time known as the 9th planet in our solar system, due to the new astronomy rules Pluto is no longer considered a planet but is now a "dwarf" planet. Located beyond Neptune in the Kuiper Belt (ring of bodies past Neptune), Pluto is smaller than our own moon and reaches temperatures of -387°F (-233°C).

Haumea — because of its distance, little is truly known about Haumea other then its odd elongated shape and it is roughly the same size as Pluto. It's orbit path around the sun takes 285 Earth years and it is made up of rock with an icy coating over the surface. This coating causes the dwarf planet to appear bright, similar to the effect of sunlight on snow on Earth.

Makemake — is a recently discovered, March of 2005, dwarf planet located in the Kuiper Belt. Slightly smaller than Pluto, Makemake's surface consists of primarily frozen nitrogen, ethane, and methane. Makemake's orbital path around the sun is approximately 310 Earth years and it, along with Eris, is responsible for the new classifications of what constitutes as a planet.

Eris — the next "dwarf" planet within the Kuiper Belt is Eris and it has the most extreme orbital path that extends well outside of our solar system. It is believed that its surface temperatures varies from -359°F (-217°C) to -405°F (-243°C). Its surface is covered in ice but as it comes closer to the sun and the ice melts, it's surface is closely similar to Pluto's.
