Ceres is located inside the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, while the other dwarf planets are located in the outer solar system in, or near to, the Kuiper belt. Another six objects are almost certainly dwarf planets, but are waiting for official classification, and there may be as many as 10,000 dwarf planets in the solar system.

WHAT IS A DWARF PLANET?
In 2006, a new and distinct class of celestial objects was named by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). They were called “dwarf planets.” According to the IAU, a celestial body is classified as a dwarf planet if it exhibits the following characteristics:

1. It is in orbit around the Sun
2. It has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape
3. It has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit; and
4. It is not a satellite (a moon)

This definition of a dwarf planet differentiates it from a planet on two criteria: unlike the dwarf planet, a planet has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit, and the definition of a planet does not include the satellite distinction.
